# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **machine learning classification techniques**. The objective is to accurately identify fraud in a **highly imbalanced dataset** and support real-time decision making for financial systems.

---

## 📊 Dataset

* Credit card transaction records
* Target label:

  * `0` → Normal transaction
  * `1` → Fraud transaction
* Dataset is highly imbalanced (very few fraud cases)

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature scaling
3. Handling class imbalance
4. Model training using classification algorithms
5. Model evaluation using appropriate metrics

---

## ✅ Final Output

* Predicts whether a transaction is **fraudulent or normal**
* Evaluates performance using **precision, recall, and F1-score**
* Demonstrates effective fraud detection despite class imbalance

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 💼 Business Use Case

This project helps banks and financial institutions:

* Detect fraudulent transactions early
* Reduce financial losses
* Improve customer trust and security

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The machine learning model successfully identifies fraudulent credit card transactions by focusing on recall and suitable evaluation metrics, making it practical for real-world financial applications.
